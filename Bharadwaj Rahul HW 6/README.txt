I used three parts from Professor's in class demonstration.

memberOfAppend, which I made into a lemma rather than a method

and

append, which I utilized exactly the way it is

and

listContains and treeContains which is based off of "member" from the in class demonstration.

Besides that, everything else was written by me. For these parts, since he did it in class, I didn't
rewrite all the proof code beneath, I just only put what was necessary to call the
functions.
